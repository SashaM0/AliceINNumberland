                Hare, the Hatter, and Sonko give several examples in which the semantic meaning of statement A is not identical to antimetabolism A (e.g., "I see what I eat" and "I eat what I see"); in logic and mathematics, the reverse is true.            </p>

The process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it.
